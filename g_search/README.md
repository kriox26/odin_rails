#### [Using the rest-client API.](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/let-s-get-building?ref=lnav)

* `#g_search` performs a Google search using the `rest-client` API methods, then prints the body of the response.


Run the program with `$ ruby g_search.rb`, the program will ask you to input the search you want to perform, after doing the search it will print the `body` of the response.
That's it!
